\usage{
write_text(path, lines, overwrite = FALSE)

read_text(path, n = -1L)

write_latex_tbl(
  data,
  path,
  append = FALSE,
  include_rn = TRUE,
  rn_label = "",
  caption = NULL,
  long = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to target file. It is created if it does not exist, but the
parent directory must exist.}

\item{lines}{Character vector of lines. For \code{write_union()}, these are lines
to add to the target file, if not already present. For \code{write_over()},
these are the exact lines desired in the target file.}

\item{overwrite}{\code{logical(1)}. If file exists, over-write it?}

\item{n}{integer.  The (maximal) number of lines to
    read.  Negative values indicate that one should read up to the end of
    input on the connection.}

\item{data}{An object that inherits from class \code{data.frame}.}

\item{append}{\code{logical(1)}. See \code{\link[=write.table]{write.table()}}.}

\item{include_rn}{\code{logical(1)}. Should the row names
(if present) of \code{data} be included?
Passed to \code{\link[=write.table]{write.table()}} as \verb{row.names =} parameter.}

\item{rn_label}{\code{character(1)}. If row names are to be
included, the column title to be used.}

\item{caption}{\code{character(1)}. A caption for the table
once in \emph{LaTeX} format.}

\item{long}{\code{logical(1)}. Should the table be written
in long format. Better for very data frames with
many rows.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to \code{\link[=write.table]{write.table()}}.}
}
\description{
Writes as UTF-8 encoding and with \verb{\\n} line
endings on UNIX systems and \verb{\\r\\n} on Windows.
This avoids some of the unintended side-effects of
\code{usethis::write_over()} with R-projects.
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{read_text()}: a convenient wrapper to \code{\link[=readLines]{readLines()}} with default
UTF-8 encoding for reading text into an R session.

\item \code{write_latex_tbl()}: write the contents of a data frame to a \emph{LaTeX} table.
